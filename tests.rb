When line is partially matched against all sentences.

New Sentence: Import page as [Word Name]: [Word Address]
	should generate regexp pattern: " /Import\ page\ as\ ([^ ]+):\ ([^ ]+)\/ "
		

Nouns found in other scope are visible if importable is set to true.

Sentence is matched AND compiled, even if it has no arguments.

Sentences matched when defined dynamically.

Sentences re-matched when partially matched.
  Second match is to match entire line.
  Example: The value of Name of Scope.
  Match 1: Name of Scope
  Match 2: The value of "Match 1".

  Name of Scope of Page of Uni

Downsides of Uni Lang
  * makes people think computers can think
  * makes people use Regular English instead of a sub-set of English.
  * makes programming look easy.
    This is not programming. 
    It's pattern matching and algorythms
      with a little natural talent.
      If you don't play with legos as 
      an adult, you have no business programming.
      Exceptions: physicists.
